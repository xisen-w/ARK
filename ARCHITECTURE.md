# idea2paper Architecture

## Design Principles

**Core idea**: Trust the AI's judgment; code handles execution and guardrails only.

- **DB as source of truth** &mdash; project config and status live in SQLite; YAML is used only for per-agent runtime state
- **Per-project isolation** &mdash; each project gets its own conda env, sandboxed HOME, and `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`
- **Skills over hard-coded rules** &mdash; modular instruction sets (skills) are loaded at runtime to enforce best practices

## Pipeline Overview

idea2paper runs three phases in sequence:

### Research Phase (5-step pipeline)

| Step | Agent/Tool | What Happens |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------------|
| 0 | — | **Setup**: provision per-project conda env (clones ark-base — research stack only, no idea2paper code; orchestrator's idea2paper is injected via `PYTHONPATH`) |
| 1 | Researcher | **Analyze Proposal**: read uploaded PDF or idea → write `idea.md` (summary, methodology, systems); output Deep Research query; parse and commit paper title |
| 2 | Gemini | **Deep Research**: literature survey → `deep_research.md`; PDF sent to user via Telegram |
| 3 | Researcher | **Specialization**: generate `project_context.md` (web-verified); specialize agent prompt templates for the project; select relevant skills (0–5) |
| 4 | — | **Bootstrap**: install builtin skills; bootstrap citations → `references.bib` |

### Review Loop

Each iteration runs 5 steps: Compile → Review → Plan → Execute → Validate.

The Planner outputs structured YAML action plans:

```yaml
actions:
  - agent: experimenter
    task: "Run perplexity validation experiment"
    priority: 1
  - agent: writer
    task: "Update Section 4.2"
    priority: 2
```

## Core Components

### 1. Memory System (`memory.py`)

Tracks scores, detects stagnation, and prevents repetitive failures:

```python
class SimpleMemory:
    scores: List[float]       # Score history (last 20)
    best_score: float         # Historical best
    stagnation_count: int     # Consecutive stagnation count

    def record_score(score)   # Record a score
    def is_stagnating()       # Stagnation detection
    def get_context()         # Get context (Goal Anchor + score trends)
```

Additional features:
- **Issue tracking**: Content-based dedup — counts how many times each issue reappears across iterations
- **Repair validation**: Verifies that attempted fixes actually resolved the issue
- **Strategy escalation**: Automatically bans ineffective methods and suggests alternatives
- **Meta-debugging**: Triggers diagnostic when the system is stuck

### 2. Goal Anchor

Every agent invocation includes a constant "Goal Anchor" that describes the project's core objectives. This prevents agents from drifting off-topic over many iterations.

### 3. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)

The Orchestrator uses a mixin-based design to compose specialized functionalities:

```python
class Orchestrator(AgentMixin, CompilerMixin, ExecutionMixin, PipelineMixin):
    # AgentMixin: agent invocation and cost tracking
    # CompilerMixin: LaTeX compilation and PDF management
    # ExecutionMixin: skill injection and command execution
    # PipelineMixin: high-level research, dev, and review loops
```

- **Dispatches** to the correct phase based on the project's current mode.
- **Syncs** status, scores, and progress to the SQLite database after each step.
- **Handles** bi-directional Telegram communication and human-in-the-loop decisions.

### 4. Skills System (`skills/`)

Modular instruction sets loaded at runtime to guide agent behavior:

| Skill | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| **research-integrity** | Anti-simulation: agents must run real experiments |
| **human-intervention** | Escalation protocol via Telegram for blockers |
| **env-isolation** | Per-project environment boundaries and security |
| **figure-integrity** | Validates that figures match actual experimental data |
| **page-adjustment** | Content density control to fit within venue page limits |

Skills are auto-installed during the Pipeline Bootstrap (Research Phase Step 4).

### 5. Environment Isolation (`website/dashboard/jobs.py`)

Each project gets a sandboxed conda environment:

- `provision_project_env()` clones the base environment to `<project>/.env/`
- `project_env_ready()` checks if the environment exists
- The Orchestrator runs with `HOME=<project_dir>` and `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`
- Both the CLI (`ark run`) and the Dashboard auto-detect and use the project-local environment.

### 6. Compute Backends (`ark/compute/`)

idea2paper supports multiple compute backends for running experiments:

- **Local**: Runs experiments directly on the host machine.
- **Slurm**: Submits jobs to HPC clusters using `sbatch`.
- **SkyPilot**: Provisions clusters across **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, or **Kubernetes** from one abstraction, with spot instances, retries, and autostop teardown built in.
- **Custom**: Extensible backend for specialized environments.

SkyPilot handles the full lifecycle: provisioning, code sync (SkyPilot `workdir`/`file_mounts`), setup, execution, result collection, and **autostop** teardown.

### 7. AI Figure Generation (`ark/nano_banana.py`)

**Nano Banana** is a Gemini-powered system for generating high-quality scientific figures:

- **Planner**: Designs a detailed visual specification based on paper context.
- **Stylist**: Refines the specification to match academic publication aesthetics.
- **Visualizer**: Generates the image using Gemini image generation models.
- **Critic**: Evaluates the figure and provides feedback for iterative improvement.

### 8. Intervention & Observability (`ark/intervention/`, `ark/observability/`)

Autonomous runs can take consequential actions — delete files, launch many
compute jobs, request/expose credentials, push or exfiltrate data, overspend.
This subsystem makes each step **visible** and the high-stakes ones **pause for
a human** (over Telegram), without touching the webapp (an `ApprovalChannel`
seam leaves room for a webapp approver later).

**Observability** (`ark/observability/steps.py`). OpenHands' `--json` mode
already streams a JSONL event per action. `OpenHandsCLI.execute()` now reads
that stream line-by-line (instead of one blocking `communicate()`), so:

- every bash command / file edit / observation / message becomes a typed
  `StepEvent`, written to `auto_research/state/agent_steps.jsonl` (full fidelity)
  and emitted as a one-line human-readable step (gated by `log_verbosity`);
- a `Redactor` scrubs secret values (`NAME=value` and registered API keys)
  before anything is logged;
- the CLI `ark monitor` and the webapp's log tail show live progress for free.

**Intervention** — three cooperating layers:

| Layer | Where | What |
|:------|:------|:-----|
| **Policy** (`policy.py`) | pure logic | Classify a command/action → (category, severity) → decision (`allow`/`notify`/`ask`/`deny`) under an autonomy level. Categories: `destructive_fs`, `bulk_compute`, `credentials`, `data_exfil`, `spend`. |
| **B — capability wrappers** (`wrappers.py`) | agent sandbox | Shadow-PATH shims for `rm`/`sbatch`/`gcloud`/`scp`/… sit first on PATH; they phone home to the gate **before** the real binary runs. A dumb shim + a smart `ApprovalWatcher` keeps all policy in one place. (Agent `git` is intentionally not wrapped — too noisy.) |
| **C — circuit breaker** (`manager.py`) | event stream | Backstop: watches the streamed actions and, on a wrapper **bypass** (absolute-path call to a risky binary), runs it through the gate and aborts the agent on denial. |

The **gate** (`gate.py`) turns an `ask` into a human verdict over a pluggable
`ApprovalChannel` (Telegram today), with **approval memory** (remember this
command shape / whole category), an **audit trail**
(`intervention_audit.jsonl`), and a **safe default of deny on timeout**. It
**fails open**: with no channel configured it auto-allows and logs, so existing
projects and CI never block.

The orchestrator's own autonomous actions are gated too — **cloud provisioning**
(`compute/skypilot.py`), **git push** (`core.git_commit`), and a
**cumulative-spend** threshold (after each agent's cost is tallied) — but
human-triggered operations (`ark clear`, delete, stop) are not.

`InterventionManager` (`manager.py`) wires it all together and is attached to the
orchestrator as `self._intervention`; `run_agent` consults it for the sandbox env
and the per-line event handler. Configure via the `intervention:` block (see
`config.example.yaml`).

### 9. SharedNet Room team (`ark/sharednet/`)

An alternative to the fixed review loop: the six agents work as members of a
[SharedNet](https://sharednet.ai) Room, a hosted append-only message log that
Agents join with an invite token (`join` / `send` / `wait`, plain HTTP). Set a
`sharednet:` block in `config.yaml` (or `SHAREDNET_INVITE`) and `ark run`
takes this path after the research phase.

- **Typed hand-offs.** Every request and result is a Room message carrying a
  typed trailer (`work.request`, `work.result`, `done`, `stopped`,
  `human_review`), the same way SharedNet's own tags travel in message
  content until its V2 `type` field lands. A human reads the text; the
  orchestrator reads the trailer (`ark/sharednet/typed.py`).
- **The Agent decides who is next.** Each agent's task ends with a hand-off
  instruction; its final `HANDOFF: {"next": …, "done": …}` line is honoured
  when it names a team role, and only the reviewer's verdict can close the
  run (score ≥ `paper_accept_threshold`). Missing or invalid decisions fall
  back to the fixed successor order; a role that keeps asking for itself is
  moved on; a hop cap posts `stopped` (`ark/sharednet/team.py`).
- **A real group chat.** Anything a human says in the Room between hops is
  folded into the next task as *Room guidance*. A new process resumes from
  the Room log alone: it finds the last `work.result` and continues.
- **Everything else stays ARK's**: prompts, `run_agent` through OpenHands,
  cost tracking, compile, score parsing, the state files
  (`ark/sharednet/ark_team.py`).

`python -m ark.sharednet --invite "…" --mock` plays a scripted team against
any Room in seconds; `--project NAME` runs the real agents; `--tail` watches.

## Agent List (6 agents)

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| researcher | Analyzes proposal → `idea.md`; literature survey; specializes agent prompts and selects skills |
| reviewer | Reviews and scores the paper; checks experiment alignment against proposal |
| planner | Analyzes issues, generates action plan (paper & dev modes); verifies experiment alignment |
| writer | Writes/revises paper sections with DBLP-verified citations |
| experimenter | Designs, runs, and analyzes experiments; supports Slurm and SkyPilot backends |
| coder | Implements code changes (dev mode) |
